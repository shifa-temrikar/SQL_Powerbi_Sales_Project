/*Explaination
SELECT clause:
•	MONTH(transaction_date) AS month: Extracts the month from the transaction_date column and renames it as month.
•	ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) AS total_sales: Calculates the total sales by multiplying unit_price and transaction_qty, then sums the result for each month. The ROUND function rounds the result to the nearest integer.
•	(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty) - LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1) OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date))) / LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1) OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date)) * 100 AS mom_increase_percentage with the functions used:
o	SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty): This calculates the total sales for the current month. It multiplies the unit_price by the transaction_qty for each transaction and then sums up these values.
o	LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1) OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date)): This function retrieves the value of the total sales for the previous month. It uses the LAG window function to get the value of the SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty) from the previous row (previous month) ordered by the transaction_date.
o	(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty) - LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1) OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date))): This part calculates the difference between the total sales of the current month and the total sales of the previous month.
o	LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1) OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date)): This function retrieves the value of the total sales for the previous month again. It's used in the denominator to calculate the percentage increase.
o	(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty) - LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1) OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date))) / LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1) OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date)): This calculates the ratio of the difference in sales between the current and previous months to the total sales of the previous month. It represents the percentage increase or decrease in sales compared to the previous month.
o	100: This part multiplies the ratio by 100 to convert it to a percentage.
•	FROM clause:
coffee_shop_sales: Specifies the table from which data is being selected.
•	WHERE clause:
MONTH(transaction_date) IN (4, 5): Filters the data to include only transactions from April and May.
•	GROUP BY clause:
MONTH(transaction_date): Groups the results by month.
•	ORDER BY clause:
MONTH(transaction_date): Orders the results by month.*/

/*Query Explanation:
•	This inner subquery calculates the total sales (unit_price * transaction_qty) for each date in May. It filters the data to include only transactions that occurred in May by using the MONTH() function to extract the month from the transaction_date column and filtering for May (month number 5).
•	The GROUP BY clause groups the data by transaction_date, ensuring that the total sales are aggregated for each individual date in May.
•	The outer query calculates the average of the total sales over all dates in May. It references the result of the inner subquery as a derived table named internal_query.
•	The AVG() function calculates the average of the total_sales column from the derived table, giving us the average sales for May.

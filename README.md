📊 Coffee Shop Sales Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes a coffee shop’s transactional sales data to uncover patterns, monitor key metrics, and provide actionable insights for business growth.

The workflow includes:

- Data Cleaning (date/time formatting, column renaming, data type corrections)

- SQL Analytics (KPIs, trends, MoM growth, product/location insights)

- Interactive Dashboard in Power BI for visualization and storytelling

🛠️ Tech Stack

- SQL: MySQL for querying and data preparation

- Power BI: Dashboard design and visualization

- Dataset: Coffee Shop Sales (transactions with date, time, product, price, location, and quantity)

📂 Dataset Description

Each record in the dataset includes:

1. transaction_id – unique identifier
2. transaction_date – purchase date
3. transaction_time – purchase time
4. store_location – shop location
5. product_category – category (e.g., coffee, tea, bakery)
6. product_type – item sold
7. unit_price – price per item
8. transaction_qty – quantity sold


💡 Business Problems & How This Project Solves Them
1. How to track overall performance?

Problem: Managers lack a quick way to measure sales, orders, and growth over time.

Solution: Built KPIs and MoM growth analysis in SQL + Power BI, enabling management to track business performance at a glance.

2. Which products drive the most revenue?

Problem: Difficult to know which categories and products are the main revenue contributors.

Solution: SQL queries + Power BI visuals highlight top products and categories, guiding stocking and marketing decisions.

3. When do customers buy the most?

Problem: Coffee shops don’t know peak sales hours and best-performing days.

Solution: Analyzed daily/weekly/hourly sales patterns → identified peak hours (morning 8–11 AM) and weekend spikes.

4. Which stores perform better?

Problem: No visibility into location-wise performance.

Solution: Store-level sales breakdown highlights high-performing stores and identifies underperformers for corrective action.

🚀 Business Impact

- Helped management increase weekend promotions, boosting already strong sales.
- Identified best-selling beverages (~40% of revenue), guiding procurement & marketing campaigns.
- Pinpointed below-average performing days/hours, enabling targeted discounts and offers.
- Improved decision-making with interactive dashboards accessible to both executives and store managers.

📌 Project Summary

- Cleaned and transformed coffee shop transactional data using SQL.

- Calculated KPIs and performed in-depth trend & product analysis.

- Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to track performance.

- Delivered actionable insights to optimize sales, product mix, and store operations.
